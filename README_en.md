**Easy-PyTorch** is a VSCode plugin designed for users, based on the earlier [vscode-pytorch](https://github.com/SvenBecker/vscode-pytorch) project. We have rebooted this project to keep it in sync with the latest versions of PyTorch, thereby providing better support. This plugin is a great tool for programming novices, making the process of using PyTorch simple and intuitive.

## Project Overview

Through this plugin, users can quickly insert pre-set code snippets covering everything from basic tensor operations to complex neural network architectures. Just a few commands or clicks allow these template codes to be inserted into your project, greatly enhancing writing efficiency.

Furthermore, Easy-PyTorch also offers a series of tutorials and tips suitable for developers of all levels, especially beginners. These tutorials guide you in understanding the role and application scenarios of each code snippet, helping you master the use of PyTorch better.

Our goal is to make programming in machine learning not only efficient but also more user-friendly, so that even programming novices can quickly get started and enjoy creating their own machine learning models.

## Features

- **Code Snippet Library**: Extensive code snippets covering various PyTorch operations, providing a shortcut to rapid programming.
- **Intelligent Tips**: As you write code, simply enter `pytorch` to see all related available code snippets.
- **High Customization**: The plugin's code snippets include placeholders, variables, and options that you can easily customize and navigate through using the Tab key.

## How to Install

### Method 1
Search for Easy PyTorch in the Visual Studio Code extension and click install.

### Method 2
Move the local project to the Visual Studio Code extensions folder, which can be done with simple file operations. Here are the general steps and precautions:

1. Determine the location of the VSCode extensions folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\\Users\\{your username}\\.vscode\\extensions`
   - **macOS**: `~/.vscode/extensions`
   - **Linux**: `~/.vscode/extensions`

2. Download and move the project:
   - **Manual Download**: Manually download and unzip to the path specified in step 1.

## How to Use

- Start by typing `pytorch` in a Python file; the system will display all related code snippets.
- Alternatively, type direct keywords like `conv`, `pooling`, etc., which supports fuzzy input.
- Select the required snippet from the popup list and press Enter to insert.
- Use the Tab key to navigate freely between the placeholders in the code snippet.

This plugin is designed to get your machine learning projects up and running faster, while also making the learning process of programming much easier. Whether you are a PyTorch novice or a developer looking to improve programming efficiency, Easy-PyTorch is the ideal choice for you.
